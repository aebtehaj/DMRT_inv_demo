Ebtehaj A., M. Durand, M. Tedesco (2021), Constrained Inversion of a Microwave Snowpack Emission Model using Dictionary Matching: Applications for GPM Satellite, *IEEE Trans. on Geosci. and Remote Sens.*, 10.1109/TGRS.2021.3115663

This article presents a new algorithmic framework for multilayer inversion of the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) equations of snowpack emission, with particular emphasis on the role of high-frequency microwave channels above 60 GHz. The approach relies on dictionary matching and locally constrained least squares. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can invert the DMRT model and retrieve depth, density, and grain size of a single-layer snowpack when dependencies of density and grain size on depth are properly accounted for.

**Figure.1** Randomized retrievals of depth $d$, density $\rho$ and grain size diameter $\delta$ using unconstrained classic nonlinear least-squares in (top row) and the introduced algorithm (bottom row). The observations are from forward simulations of the DMRT-QCA model at GMI frequency channels (10-166 GHz) in the absence of model and observation error -- assuming a single-layer representation of snowpack.
